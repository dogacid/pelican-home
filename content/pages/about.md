Title: About me

I'm a consultant who likes to help leaders, groups and organisations work towards productive outcomes. I do this by identify systematic issues, provide the appropriate action oriented learning, and measure the impact for feedback.

I've worked heavily with Technology groups, Customer facing teams, and all levels of Leadership in many types of organisations and industries.

Starting out as a Bank Officer in the late 1980's then as Software Technical Lead by the dot com boom, I moved to Sydney and worked for the successful fintech [tyro payments](http://tyro.com) as a team of founding engineers until settling at [ThoughtWorks Australia](http://www.thoughtworks.com).

As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, I consult on organisational change efforts, help our teams do the best they can for our clients, and lead programmes of work.

I spend my professional learning time researching the theories and methods that are effective in leading and changing individuals, customers, teams, and organisations. Researching fields such as *Psychology* and *Statisitics* for insights to improve my capability.

I follow the work of Edgar H. Schein, J. Richard Hackman, Chris Argyris, W. Edward Deming, Donald H. Wheeler, John Seddon, Roger Schwarz, Bob Moesta, and the psychoanalytic community.


I've actively founded two meet-up groups in Perth and Melbourne:

- [Agile-Perth](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Perth/)
- [#JTBD Melbourne](http://meetup.com/Melbourne-Jobs-To-Be-Done-Meetup/)

I've presented at [Agile Australia](http://www.agileaustralia.com.au/2012/speakers.html#Marc-Galbraith), various meet-ups, and presented at these events:
